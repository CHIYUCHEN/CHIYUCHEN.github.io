A choropleth map is used to visualize and communicate the spatial distribution and variation of a particular variable, such as population density, by using different colors or shades to represent different levels of the variable. It can quickly highlight areas with high or low values, and help identify patterns or trends across regions. This type of map is commonly used in fields such as geography, sociology, economics, and public policy to analyze and present data on various social and economic phenomena, and to inform decision-making and policy development.

## Proportional Map

A proportional symbol map is used to visualize and communicate the spatial distribution and variation of a particular variable, such as population, by using different sizes of symbols to represent different levels of the variable. It can quickly highlight areas with high or low values, and help identify patterns or trends across regions.

## Chart

A pie chart is used to represent data as a circle divided into wedges, with each wedge representing a proportion or percentage of the total. The purpose of a pie chart is to show how different parts contribute to a whole, and to compare the relative sizes of these parts. It is easy to read and understand, even for people with limited experience in data analysis. The use of different colors or shading for each wedge can also make it easier to distinguish between different categories and to highlight the most important data.
